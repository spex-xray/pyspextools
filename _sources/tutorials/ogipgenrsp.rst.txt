OGIPGENRSP - Create dummy response files
========================================

Ogipgenrsp is a script to generate a dummy (Gaussian) response file with a user provided effective area, energy scale
and energy resolution. This is particularly helpful when creating responses for possible future missions. The resulting
response file is in OGIP RSP format. If you need a spectrum and response in SPEX format based on this
new matrix, you can run the :ref:`simres` script in this package with the RSP file from this script as input.

Since the bin size of the response depends on the input resolution, the original binning of the ARF file may not be
appropriate. Therefore, this script linearly interpolates the energies from the input ARF array to the new output grid.

- Please note that this script creates a simple diagonal matrix with a Gaussian distribution function. Although this
  is usually a good approximation, X-ray detectors will have a much more complicated response in reality.

- Please also note that this script creates a square matrix, which is usually not optimal. Optimal binning, as
  explained in `Kaastra & Bleeker 2016 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...587A.151K/abstract>`_, is still to
  be implemented.

The parameters of simres can be shown on the command line by the '-h' flag::

    ogipgenrsp -h

Energy dependent resolution
---------------------------

Instead of a constant spectral resolution (FWHM) for the entire band, it is also possible to make the resolution
linearly depend on the energy. The linear dependence is implemented in data/response.py and integrated in the
gaussrsp function. The resulting FWHM(E) for energy E in keV is calculated as follows::

    FWHM(E) = FWHM(@1 keV) + DELTA_FWHM * (E - 1.0)

The FWHM(@ 1keV) is set by the --resolution flag (in eV) and DELTA_FWHM is set by the --resgradient flag (in eV per keV).

Example
-------

In the example below, we create a new matrix for new mission with a spectral resolution of 1 eV and an energy range
of 0.1 to 10 keV::

    linux:~> ogipgenrsp --arffile athena.arf --resolution 1.0 --range 0.1:10 --rspfile newmission.rsp --overwrite
    ==================================
     This is ogipgenrsp version 0.2.8
    ==================================

    Reading ARF file... OK
    Reading ARF file... OK
    Number of energy bins: 49500
    Number of channels per group: 50
    Calculate response matrix... OK
    Check the created RSP matrix... OK
    Write RSP to file... OK

The new matrix will contain 49500 bins and each response group will have 50 response elements for which the Gaussian
response is calculated.

The resulting response file is in OGIP RSP format. If you need a spectrum and response in SPEX format based on this
new matrix, you can run the :ref:`simres` script in this package with the RSP file from this script as input.
